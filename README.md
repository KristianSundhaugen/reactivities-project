# Reactivities Project

This project is based on Neil Cummings' course: [Complete Guide to Building an App with .NET Core and React](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react/).

The Reactivities project is a multi-project ASP.NET Core solution that follows the principles of Clean Architecture and utilizes the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Mediator pattern.

## Key Learnings

During this project, I gained knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- Setting up the developer environment
- Creating a multi-project solution using ASP.NET Core WebAPI and React with TypeScript using the DotNet CLI and create-react-app utility
- Implementing Clean Architecture and utilizing the CQRS and Mediator pattern
- Configuring ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication
- Working with React and TypeScript
- Implementing client-side login and registration functionality in the React application
- Utilizing React Router for navigation
- Using AutoMapper in ASP.NET Core for object mapping
- Building visually appealing user interfaces using Semantic UI
- Adding a photo upload widget and creating user profile pages
- Implementing reusable form inputs with validation using React Final Form
- Implementing paging, sorting, and filtering functionality
- Enabling real-time web communication using SignalR for a chat feature in the application
- Publishing the application to both IIS and Linux
- Achieving an 'A' rating for security from a well-known security scanning site

## Skills Acquired

By working on this project, I acquired the following skills:
